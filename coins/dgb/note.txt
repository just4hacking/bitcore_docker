Hi Sergey,

That's great news!
As per here: https://www.dgbwiki.com/index.php?title=Running_your_own_Insight_explorer
~~~
Now that we have it downloaded, we want to install the other prerequisites:
npm install
Then we're going to sync insight with DigiByte Core. We do this manually on first-run, as it won't resume unless it's 97% sync'd
~/insight/node_modules/insight-bitcore-api/util/sync.js -D -v --rpc
-D tells it to delete the existing data (There shouldn't be any anyways, but in case there's been an issue and you're running this a second time around...)
-v tells it to be verbose
--rpc tells it to use RPC, rather than the index files
This process will likely take 12+ hours, depending on your CPU.
Once completed, you should still be in ~/insight, and so can simply run:
node start
~~~

Let me know how that goes :)

Cheers
